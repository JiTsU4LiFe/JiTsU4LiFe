- 👋 Hi, I’m @JiTsU4LiFe My name is Justin. Just so everyone knows  
- 👀 I’m interested in Brazillian Jiu jitsu, hence Jitsu4Life... Everyone needs a hobby
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science, or some type of Computer Security Architecture
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that is security related. Whether it be Security Architecture, Cloud Security, Threat Hunting,. etc..
- 📫 How to reach me ... xxjbartels@yahoo.com is probably the best way to get a hold of me, other then giving out my phone number. I get a lot of random phone calls enough as is.
